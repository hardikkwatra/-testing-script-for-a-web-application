# -testing-script-for-a-web-application

### Explaination

- The script uses Selenium WebDriver to automate browser interactions for E2E testing, cross-browser testing, and other types of testing.
- The `test_end_to_end_workflow()` function represents an E2E test case, simulating a user login scenario and verifying successful navigation to the dashboard page.
- The `test_cross_browser_compatibility()` function uses pytest's parameterization feature to run the same test case on different browsers (Chrome and Firefox) for cross-browser testing.
- The `test_performance_under_load()` function simulates multiple users accessing the application concurrently to test its performance under load.
- The `test_security_vulnerabilities()`, `test_accessibility()`, and `test_usability()` functions represent test cases for security testing, accessibility testing, and usability testing, respectively. These test cases may involve using specialized tools or techniques to identify and verify security vulnerabilities, accessibility issues, and usability problems.
